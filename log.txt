LOG/ROADMAP
1. basic implementation. script like
2. OOP
3. simplified model (resources = fitness), improved visualisation

TODO:
start experiments:
- show effects of different parameters on sigmoid curve (binary fitness, higher decay, bernoulli patches)
- deletion experiment: initialise at full coverage -> erase patch -> observe recoverage for different resource distributions
    => combine with reproductive strategies (e.g. trade-off dispersal & likelihood of establishment)


(- frequency associated effect, interactions with resources, add multiple species => evolutionary simulations)
