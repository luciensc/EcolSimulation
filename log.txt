LOG/ROADMAP
1. basic implementation. script like
2. OOP
3. simplified model (resources = fitness), improved visualisation

TODO:
start experiments:
- repeat runs: stochastic effect of multiple initialisations on same grid
continuously distributed ecol/fitness values, no stochastic population (i.e. BERNOULLI = False)
- compare different decay params on same grid over time
- grid vs init variance

investigate effect of different spatial resource/fitness distributions (continuous, binary, non-random)
    - investigate cases where v low dispersal can lead to not reaching carrying capacity
    - deletion experiment: initialise at full coverage -> erase patch -> observe recovery for different resource distributions
    => combine with reproductive strategies (e.g. trade-off dispersal & likelihood of establishment)

- variation of plot fitness over time

(- frequency associated effect, interactions with resources, add multiple species => evolutionary simulations)
