WORK IN PROGRESS

Represent species distribution on a 2D grid, simulate development over time.

### V1
- proof of concept implementation
- considering population dynamics in different settings:
  - effect of spatial distributions of resources
  - response to population/spatial perturbations
  - compare different dispersal strategies

*TODO:* **V2:** investigate dynamics between two species with different fitness functions.
